class IDirs
-----------

   - implement frozen/enabled attributes
   - make behaviour robust for readonly idirs (files not owned by you)
   - better strategy for handling file conflicts; for instance Carp-Clan
     and Date-Calc from the ActiveState repo are both installing the same
     files and we currently fail with a "column path is not unique(1) at dbdimp.c"
     exception.
   - rollback of install does not remove directories it might have created
   - install scripts (pre/post/uninstall)
   - update HTML index and generate HTML docs on install
   - relocation on install (should be in class Client perhaps)
   - sync_db should spend more effort on determining metadata for packages
     it discovers via .packlist files (repo, search.cpan.org,...)
   - track unknown files not found in .packlists (create PPM-Orphans package)
   - track installdate/updatedate for packages
   - track PPD location (from where was the package installed)
   - verify should allow callbacks to override the 'print' behaviour
   - When uninstalling files, delete directories that end up empty (like
     p4's rmdir option).
   - more tests

class Client
------------
   - even more idirs?  Any need?
   - use something else than $ENV{HOME} on Windows/MacOS
   - move more of the install logic here (out of ppm)
   - improve search interface
   - incremental repo_sync
   - REST repo
   - SOAP repo

class Package
-------------
   - modules method (filtered and prettified 'provides').
   - Unicode fields (author, abstract)

module Web
----------
   - download method (something that reports progress) and ensure
     proper successful download
   - multiple downloads at the same time
   - PPD download that aborts as soon as it discovers that what it
     downloads isn't an XML <SOFTPKG> file.
   - pipelined fetch of PPD files

ppm4
----
   - query should take search pattern as argument?
   - query should list more attributes
   - usage
   - missing commands
      - 'ppm upgrade' should report recommended upgrades
      - belong
      - help
   - create temp repo for 'ppm install http://example.com/Foo.ppd'.  If 'Foo.ppd'
     contains package 'Foo' and depends on package 'Bar', then look for
     'http://example.com/Bar.ppd' before looking in other repos.

ppm4-gui
--------
   - design it
   - implement it

test suite
----------
   - more tests

documentation
-------------
   - how to set up repo
