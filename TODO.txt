Databases
---------
   - use 'pragma user_version' to determine if tables need to be set up.
     can also be used to check if schema needs to be upgraded.
   - check for readonly tables; http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.db.sqlite.general/5171
     

class IDirs
-----------

   - implement frozen/enabled attributes
   - make behaviour robust for readonly idirs (files not owned by you)
   - sync_db should spend more effort on determining metadata for packages
     it discovers via .packlist files (repo, search.cpan.org,...)
   - track unknown files not found in .packlists (create PPM-Orphans package)
   - track installdate/updatedate for packages
   - more tests

class Repo
----------
   - improve search interface
   - intelligent sync (
   - REST repo
   - SOAP repo
   - merge all repo databases with "ATTACH DATABASE" and views that put all
     packages in a single table.

class Package
-------------
   - modules method (filtered and prettified 'provides').
   - Unicode fields (author, abstract)

class Client
------------
   - home idirs

ppm4
----
   - query should take search pattern as argument?
   - query should list more attributes
   - usage
   - missing commands
      - belong
      - help
   - create temp repo for 'ppm install http://example.com/Foo.ppd'.  If 'Foo.ppd'
     contains package 'Foo' and depends on package 'Bar', then look for
     'http://example.com/Bar.ppd' before looking in other repos.

ppm4-gui
--------
   - design it
   - implemnt it

test suite
----------
   - more tests

documentation
-------------
   - how to set up repo
