ActivePerl Business Edition
---------------------------

The plan is to only make the latest ActivePerl 8xx and 10xx for Windows, Mac OS
X and Linux freely available.  Older releases and releases for other platforms
requires a business edition license (called BE-license) with a valid
subscription.

An installed BE-license contains enough information to identify the user, but
not information about over what time period the license is valid.  This
information is only available server side.  We want users to be able to renew
their license without having to install anything on their clients.

There will be separate PPM repos for the freee ActivePerl and for those with
the BE-license.  The free repos will only contain the latest build of each
distribution.  There will only be free repo for Windows x86-32, Mac OS X and
Linux x86-32 and x86-64.  There will be free repos for both 8xx and 10xx series
of releases.
