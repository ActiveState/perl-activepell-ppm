In this document we'll try to describe another approach to how ppm might behave
after the introduction of the BE-license.  The background information is still
found in the sibling document 'business-edition-take1.txt'.

In this take the user does not have to care about the difference between the
'activestate' and the 'activestate-be' repo.  There is only the 'activestate'
repo and its URL change automatically to give you the BE-repo when you have the
license installed and you are not denied access.

The "rules" are:

    ppm starts out with 'repo 1' set to http://ppm4.activestate.com/<arch>/...
    as it does today (even for builds without a free repo where the above URL
    would be a 404).

    # ppm checks if it should change the URL each time it need to sync the repo:
    foreach repo (repos) 
	upgrade_attempt = false
        if repo.url =~ /ppm4\.activestate\.com/:
	    if have BE-license:
	        repo.url =~ s/\.activestate\.com/-be.activestate.com/
		upgrade_attempt = true
	retry:
	    resp = GET(repo.url)
	    if resp.is_success:
		if upgrade_attempt:
		    print "Switching to BE-repo...\n" 
		process_packlist(resp.content)
	    elsif resp.code == 403 && repo.url =~ /ppm4-be\.activestate\.com/:
		repo.url =~ s/ppm4-be\./ppm4\./
		if not upgrade_attempt:
		    print "BE-license expired\n" + resp.content
		upgrade_attempt = false
		goto retry
	    elsif repo.code == 404:
		print resp.status_line
		if resp.content_type == 'text/plain':
		    print resp.content  # upsell
	    else:
		print resp.status_line
		# process as done today

In the pseudo-code above assignment to repo.url is considered persistent, so
if the value change it will start out changed the next time the ppm client is
invoked.

This approach has the drawback that when the BE-license is installed and the
BE-subscription has expired then the ppm client will be slowed down by always
trying to contact the BE-repo first.  If we want we could improve on this by
storing a time stamp like 'last_be_upgrade_attempt' and only try the upgrade
again after some time has passed since the last attempt.
